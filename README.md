# Juaniquillo's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website.

## Getting Started

To work with this website locally, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Development Server:**
    To start the development server with hot-reloading:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    npm start
    ```
    Access the site at the local address provided in your console (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

3.  **Build for Production:**
    To compile and minify the project for production, generating optimized static assets:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The optimized output will be located in the `dist` directory.

4.  **Preview Production Build:**
    To serve the production build locally (useful for testing the optimized build before deployment):
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
